## Fork of the unofficial HAVOC

I own a chinese flavored H1 Portapack. This particular fork is finetuned for this model, although it works perfectly OK (AFAIK) on H2 models.

This repository is my coding "buffer" before pulling requests into eried/portapack-mayhem repository, which represents at this time and date one of the main efforts (if not the only one) to keep fixing and further developing the HAVOC version, now re-bautized into "MAYHEM"
